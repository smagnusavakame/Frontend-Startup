# Frontend-Startup
Created this when I began analyzing how to analyze html, css and Javascript. Its a beginning to my journey in Web Development. Its a sample portfolio website that I tried creating on my own.

It consists of three files.
Index.html - which contains some html files that I wrote while trying to understand basic html concepts.
Index. css - which has the styling of the structure of our html.
script .js - which contains the javascript files to add functionality to our webpage.

Funfact : This is really basic and I look forward to beautiyfing this webpage soon as I add more knowledge to myself.
